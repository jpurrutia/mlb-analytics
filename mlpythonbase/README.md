# Python ML Learning

## 1. Machine Learning
Finding patterns in numbers and exploit them to make predictions.
Mathematically modelling patterns in sets of numbers.

Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification) - positive vs negative
Image Classification - categorical labeling/classification


ML vs AI
ML is subset of AI
AI is ML plus expert systes and reinforcement learning.
Deep Learning is subset of ML performed with neural networks.

GPUs provide necessary compute to train advance Neural networks.

Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning

supervised - make predictions, data has labels
- US Postal Service turns handwritten zip codes into digits that computer can recognize to sort mail.
- Credit card purchases to detect fraud.


unsupervised - provide insights into existing data, or group into categories and categorize future inputs accordingly. Data has no labels.
- inspecting records regarding products purchased from your company and the customers who purchased them to determine which customers might be most interested in a product you are launching and then building a marketing campaign that targets those customers.

- k-Means clustering: group data by similarity
- n data samples and m clusters specified
- cluster centroid
